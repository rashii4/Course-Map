\# AI Usage Statement



AI was used during this project mainly to help with debugging, improving code structure, and refining explanations. I used it as a support tool when I was stuck or needed clarification, especially when working with NetworkX and structuring the analysis.



All code was reviewed, tested, and understood by me. The overall project design, scraping approach, graph modeling, and interpretation of results reflect my own understanding and decisions.



AI was used to assist the learning process, not to replace it.
